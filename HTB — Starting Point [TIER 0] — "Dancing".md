# HTB — Starting Point [TIER 0] — "Dancing"

`made on December 21, 2025`

We're back with our third box, but this time focused on a Windows protocol: SMB.

SMB stands for Server Message Block and operates on port 445.

SMB is a network communication protocol used for sharing files, printers, and other resources between computers on a network. It allows applications to read and write to files on remote servers, facilitating resource access and inter-process communication.

So, let’s dive into our box!
